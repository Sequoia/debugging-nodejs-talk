## Notes from first pass

* Tighten up timing & flow through debug stuff
* TRANSITIONS!! It feels like you're bouncing around

* ALL TEXT must be big
* Questions about how things should be used.... How to do timers etc.


# Content

In order of importance of getting it written, can reorganize later

## Advanced debugging

## IDE Stuff ?

* Type hinting: even just 5min for this
  * JSDoc
  * JSONSchema
  * Typings https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node

    * maybe try using ext thing?

* arguments
* env vars
* tons of other configurations
