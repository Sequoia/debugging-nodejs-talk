## Advanced debugging

* Node debugger
* `node --inspect`
* CPU snapshots
* Heap dump
* Flame charts

## IDE Stuff

* Type hinting:
  * JSDoc
  * JSONSchema

## Time Allowing (save for last)

## COMPOUND LAUNCH CONFIGURATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (possible demo)

## Setting up two things

## running together

##

* **More VSCODE**
  * Running tasks
    * setting up task runner
    * build task, running
    * background tasks
